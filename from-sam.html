            Hey y’all! My name is Sam. I’m a native North Carolinian from Monroe in Union County. Growing up in a rural but diverse community, I witnessed dedicated folks going above and beyond to work for its success. As a son of two public servants, I know what hard work looks like. I brought that work ethic to the Senate, and I hope to do the same as Student Body President.
            <br /><br />
            I learned how to work with all kinds of people and that controversy sometimes means you're doing the right thing. At the very end of my Senior year, I led the charge to change my high school’s mascot from the “Rebels” to a more unifying mascot.
            <br /><br />
            I lost a lot of friends over that decision, but I’ve never lost sleep over it. Fighting for what’s right and working for change is more important than being popular. As Student Body President, I’ll stand up to the Administration and to injustice everywhere. 
            <br /><br />
            Besides student government and politics, my passions include playing the piano, strumming the guitar, reading biographies, and playing golf. You can also catch me working at MAW during the week, or at Finley Golf Course after church on Sunday. 
            <br /><br />
            After graduating from undergrad, I hope to be right back here and attend UNC Law School. This community has given me more than I ever could have asked for. Now I’m asking you for the opportunity to continue serving. I promise to always lead clear and true to help build a future for all Tar Heels.
