Dear Carolina Community, 

My name is Sam Robinson. I am so proud to be a candidate for Student Body President here at the nation’s finest and oldest public university! I’m from Monroe, North Carolina, and graduated from Parkwood High School. When I first got my acceptance letter in January of 2020, a dream came true for me. Becoming a Tar Heel was everything to me then, and it means even more now. I have come to understand what Charles Kuralt meant when he said “Our love for this place is based on the fact that it is, as it was meant to be, the University of the people.” 

In the last year, this community has faced historic challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic, a mental health crisis, ongoing institutional racism, and ineffective leadership have shaken this university to its core. Our administration hasn’t risen to the challenges we’ve faced. President Lamar Richards has been an outstanding advocate for student voices, but many of the systems surrounding his administration have unfortunately been ineffective. 

Despite this extremely challenging state of our university, I have hope. I see the members of the Carolina Community rise and flourish despite immense challenges both internal and external. My belief in the future of Carolina is rooted in my belief in you, my fellow students. 

I would be honored if you would choose me to represent your interests to the Board of Trustees and to the broader Carolina Community. My team and I have been listening to what you want and what you think Carolina should be. We recognize that Carolina needs empathy and experience. My promise to you is to be a mouthpiece for your vision of a more equitable and more transparent Carolina; to bring your ideas behind the closed doors where unfortunately, most decisions are made. After all, we are not responsible for the problems of today, but we are responsible for the solutions of tomorrow. 

My team and I have created a platform that will create sweeping reforms to the way student government operates in its own right and interacts with the community. Our platform pillars of Accessibility, Transparency, and Equity are the foundation of the plan. In the following pages, you will see my team’s plans to combat issues from Mental Health to Accessibility and dozens of others in between. In the spirit of our pillars, we encourage you to reach out to our team on social media or at robinsonforsbp@gmail.com to share your feedback on our platform. Everyone has a story, and we want to hear yours. After all, how could I promise to embody these pillars while governing if I don’t live them out while campaigning. 

My time here at Carolina has solidified two things for me: I love this University, and I can’t stand to watch this place fail it’s most important asset: you. I look forward to meeting you in the coming days. Let’s Lead Clear and True! Together, we can build a future for all Tar Heels!

Sincerely, 

Samuel C. Robinson
