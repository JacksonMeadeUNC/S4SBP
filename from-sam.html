        Those who know Sam understand that chairing the Rules and Judiciary Committee in the Senate has prepared him with the experience and work ethic necessary to get things done. His time in the Undergraduate Senate and beyond has more than prepared him for the brass tacks of making policy and delivering for our student body. With experience to light the way, Sam envisions a Carolina where empathy can meet action. It is no secret that this University is flawed; it can sometimes feel like a cold and lonely place. Sam believes that it can also be a place capable of immense empathy and love. When Sam envisions Carolina, he doesnâ€™t see us at the pits of failures; he sees us rising to our successes. He imagines the Dean Smith Center erupting in cheers after a game winning shot. He sees a researcher making a stunning breakthrough on vaccine technology. He sees friends coming together when times are dark and carrying each other through it. Sam sees a Carolina of boundless possibility for doing good and bettering itself. This is the vision in which our campaign is rooted, and this is the vision that inspires this platform. When you have a worker like Sam, all you really need is a vision to pair empathy to action.
