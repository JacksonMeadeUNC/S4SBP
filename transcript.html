            My name is Sam Robinson. Just one year ago, I stood here at the Old Well, the symbol of this nation’s oldest and finest public University, to declare my candidacy for the Undergraduate Senate. Now, I am proud to announce that I am running for the office of UNC’s Student Body President. In the last year alone, this community has faced historic challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic, a mental health crisis, ongoing institutional racism, and ineffective leadership have shaken this university to its core. Our administration simply hasn’t risen to the challenges we’ve faced. President Lamar Richards has been an outstanding advocate for student voices, but many of the systems surrounding his administration have unfortunately been ineffective. 
            Yet, despite the current state of our university, I have hope. I see the students of this university rise and flourish despite immense challenges both internal and external. I am so proud to call myself a Tarheel because of you, my fellow students. 
            <br /><br />
            I would be honored if you would choose me to represent your interests to the Board of Trustees and to the broader Carolina community. My team and I have been listening to what you want and what you think Carolina should be. We recognize that Carolina needs empathy, experience, and action. My promise to you is to be a mouthpiece for your vision of a more equitable and more transparent Carolina; to bring your ideas behind the closed doors where unfortunately, most decisions are made. After all, we are not responsible for the problems of today, but we are responsible for the solutions of tomorrow. 
            <br /><br />
            My platform consists of sweeping reforms to this University. Some of my key plans include new student advisory boards to the UNC Chapel Hill police department and to CAPS, a food pantry run and funded by student government, and a new office of Administrative Relations to ensure student organizations are heard. My platform also has plans that address (45) key issues facing the Carolina Community today. I invite you to explore them in detail at samforunc.com. If you see we missed something, or you wanna join our team, please feel free to fill out the contact form. Everyone has a story, and we want to hear yours.
            <br /><br />
            My time in the Senate has given me the honor of representing my fellow students and has taught me how the levers of student government work. On day 1, I am ready to start making my platform into a reality. I want our University to be in the national news for the achievements of our students, not the mistakes of our administration.  
            <br /><br />
            My time here at Carolina has solidified two things for me: I love this University, and I can’t stand to watch this place fail it’s most important asset: you. 
            <br /><br />
            Together, let’s lead clear and true. We CAN build a future for all Tar Heels.
